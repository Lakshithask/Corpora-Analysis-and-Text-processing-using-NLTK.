      "When Americans think of cheesecake now, it's most often associated with a product that has a cream cheese base.

      "In 1880, Lawrence began distributing his cream cheese in foil wrappers under the auspices of the Empire Cheese Company of South Edmeston, New York, where he manufactured the product. However, you might know it better by the more famous name Lawrence came up with for his \"not Neufchâtel\"—Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese.\n",

      "In 1903, the Phoenix Cheese Company bought Lawrence's business—and with it, the Philadelphia trademark. In 1928, the brand was bought by the Kraft Cheese Company. James L. Kraft invented pasteurized cheese in 1912, which led to the development of pasteurized Philadelphia Brand cream cheese, currently the most popular cheese used for cheesecake making.

      "Cream Cheese Cheesecake—The cheesecake most Americans grew up with is one or another version of a cream cheese cheesecake. At the bottom of such cheesecakes, you’ll usually find a crust made of crushed Graham crackers or other cookies (Oreos are a top choice for chocolate cheesecakes) that have been blended with butter and tamped into the bottom of a pan or mold. Cheesecakes that rely on a custard base must be baked. (The original New York Cheesecake that hails from Junior's on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn is a baked cheesecake.) However, there are scads of recipes that use a blend of other rich ingredients—such as sour cream, Greek yogurt, or heavy cream—that firm up in the refrigerator to create a “no-bake cheesecake.”\n"

      "in 1880, lawrence began distributing his cream cheese in foil wrappers under the auspices of the empire cheese company of south edmeston, new york, where he manufactured the product. however, you might know it better by the more famous name lawrence came up with for his \"not neufchâtel\"—philadelphia brand cream cheese.\n",

(the original new york cheesecake that hails from junior's on flatbush avenue in brooklyn is a baked cheesecake.) however, there are scads of recipes that use a blend of other rich ingredients—such as sour cream, greek yogurt, or heavy cream—that firm up in the refrigerator to create a “no-bake cheesecake.”\n"
